🔧 **MicroSandbox**: Use `<microsandbox><execute>your_python_code</execute></microsandbox>` or `<microsandbox><microsandbox_execute>your_python_code</microsandbox_execute></microsandbox>`\n          - ✅ **Action Aliases**: You can use 'execute', 'run', 'exec', or 'microsandbox_execute' - all are valid\n          - ✅ **DO**: Small, focused calculations or analysis on data you received from other tools\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Large scripts that simulate data or solve everything at once\n        - 🔧 **Browser**: Use `<browser_use><browser_search_google>your_query</browser_search_google></browser_use>` with proper query format\n          - ✅ **DO**: Search for specific, real information you need\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Use as a formality when you already \"know\" the answer\n        - 🔧 **DeepSearch**: Use `<deepsearch><research>your_question</research></deepsearch>` for research tasks\n          - ✅ **DO**: Genuine research for information you don't have\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Performative research to validate pre-generated answers\n        - 🔄 **Memory Staging**: Use `<memory_staging><memory_write>{\"key\": \"data_name\", \"value\": data}</memory_write></memory_staging>` to solve information silos\n          - ✅ **CRITICAL FOR COMPLEX TASKS**: Save search results, API data, or calculated values for use in subsequent steps\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_write immediately after getting important data from search tools\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        - At least 2 separate tool calls\n        - Each tool call must build on previous results\n        - No single tool call should solve the entire problem\n        - Results from each tool must influence the next step\n\n        3. **Execution Trigger**: You MUST end your tool calls with `<execute_tools />` to signal the system to execute them.\n        4. **Execution Control**:\n            - **Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        - Example: \"What's the weather in Paris?\" → Search → Answer\n        \n        **Complex Tasks (3+ steps)**: MANDATORY step-by-step progression\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Break into distinct phases with separate tool calls\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        - If multiple approaches fail, provide a partial answer based on available information\n        \n        **🚨 FINAL REMINDER: GENUINE STEP-BY-STEP REASONING REQUIRED 🚨**\n        \n        You are an AI that must demonstrate REAL reasoning through tool usage:\n        - Each `<think>` block should reflect genuine uncertainty or planning for the NEXT step only\n        - Each tool call should discover information you don't already have\n        - Each result should genuinely influence your next decision\n        - Never write code that \"happens\" to contain the full solution with reasoning in comments\n        - Never create simulated data when real data should be searched for\n        - Break complex tasks into 3-5 distinct tool calls\n        \n        **Your reasoning should be:** \"I need to find X, then based on X I'll do Y, then based on Y I'll conclude Z\"\n        **NOT:** \"I know the answer is Z, let me use tools to demonstrate how to get to Z\"\n\n        **The question is:**\n        \n        🔍 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**\n        \n        **BEFORE YOUR FIRST RESPONSE, ASK YOURSELF:**\n        \n        **🚨 EXECUTION FAILURE PREVENTION:**\n        -

✅ **Action Aliases**: You can use 'execute', 'run', 'exec', or 'microsandbox_execute' - all are valid\n          - ✅ **DO**: Small, focused calculations or analysis on data you received from other tools\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Large scripts that simulate data or solve everything at once\n        - 🔧 **Browser**: Use `<browser_use><browser_search_google>your_query</browser_search_google></browser_use>` with proper query format\n          - ✅ **DO**: Search for specific, real information you need\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Use as a formality when you already \"know\" the answer\n        - 🔧 **DeepSearch**: Use `<deepsearch><research>your_question</research></deepsearch>` for research tasks\n          -

✅ **CRITICAL FOR COMPLEX TASKS**: Save search results, API data, or calculated values for use in subsequent steps\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_write immediately after getting important data from search tools\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        -

**Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        -

✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        -

✅ **Action Aliases**: You can use 'execute', 'run', 'exec', or 'microsandbox_execute' - all are valid\n          - ✅ **DO**: Small, focused calculations or analysis on data you received from other tools\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Large scripts that simulate data or solve everything at once\n        - 🔧 **Browser**: Use `<browser_use><browser_search_google>your_query</browser_search_google></browser_use>` with proper query format\n          - ✅ **DO**: Search for specific, real information you need\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Use as a formality when you already \"know\" the answer\n        - 🔧 **DeepSearch**: Use `<deepsearch><research>your_question</research></deepsearch>` for research tasks\n          - ✅ **DO**: Genuine research for information you don't have\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Performative research to validate pre-generated answers\n        - 🔄 **Memory Staging**: Use `<memory_staging><memory_write>{\"key\": \"data_name\", \"value\": data}</memory_write></memory_staging>` to solve information silos\n          - ✅ **CRITICAL FOR COMPLEX TASKS**: Save search results, API data, or calculated values for use in subsequent steps\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_write immediately after getting important data from search tools\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        -

**Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        -

✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        -

✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        - At least 2 separate tool calls\n        - Each tool call must build on previous results\n        - No single tool call should solve the entire problem\n        - Results from each tool must influence the next step\n\n        3. **Execution Trigger**: You MUST end your tool calls with `<execute_tools />` to signal the system to execute them.\n        4. **Execution Control**:\n            - **Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        - Example: \"What's the weather in Paris?\" → Search → Answer\n        \n        **Complex Tasks (3+ steps)**: MANDATORY step-by-step progression\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Break into distinct phases with separate tool calls\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        - If multiple approaches fail, provide a partial answer based on available information\n        \n        **🚨 FINAL REMINDER: GENUINE STEP-BY-STEP REASONING REQUIRED 🚨**\n        \n        You are an AI that must demonstrate REAL reasoning through tool usage:\n        - Each `<think>` block should reflect genuine uncertainty or planning for the NEXT step only\n        - Each tool call should discover information you don't already have\n        - Each result should genuinely influence your next decision\n        - Never write code that \"happens\" to contain the full solution with reasoning in comments\n        - Never create simulated data when real data should be searched for\n        - Break complex tasks into 3-5 distinct tool calls\n        \n        **Your reasoning should be:** \"I need to find X, then based on X I'll do Y, then based on Y I'll conclude Z\"\n        **NOT:** \"I know the answer is Z, let me use tools to demonstrate how to get to Z\"\n\n        **The question is:**\n        \n        🔍 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**\n        \n        **BEFORE YOUR FIRST RESPONSE, ASK YOURSELF:**\n        \n        **🚨 EXECUTION FAILURE PREVENTION:**\n        -

✅ **Action Aliases**: You can use 'execute', 'run', 'exec', or 'microsandbox_execute' - all are valid\n          - ✅ **DO**: Small, focused calculations or analysis on data you received from other tools\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Large scripts that simulate data or solve everything at once\n        - 🔧 **Browser**: Use `<browser_use><browser_search_google>your_query</browser_search_google></browser_use>` with proper query format\n          - ✅ **DO**: Search for specific, real information you need\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Use as a formality when you already \"know\" the answer\n        - 🔧 **DeepSearch**: Use `<deepsearch><research>your_question</research></deepsearch>` for research tasks\n          -

**Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        -

✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        -

✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        - At least 2 separate tool calls\n        - Each tool call must build on previous results\n        - No single tool call should solve the entire problem\n        - Results from each tool must influence the next step\n\n        3. **Execution Trigger**: You MUST end your tool calls with `<execute_tools />` to signal the system to execute them.\n        4. **Execution Control**:\n            - **Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        - Example: \"What's the weather in Paris?\" → Search → Answer\n        \n        **Complex Tasks (3+ steps)**: MANDATORY step-by-step progression\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Break into distinct phases with separate tool calls\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        - If multiple approaches fail, provide a partial answer based on available information\n        \n        **🚨 FINAL REMINDER: GENUINE STEP-BY-STEP REASONING REQUIRED 🚨**\n        \n        You are an AI that must demonstrate REAL reasoning through tool usage:\n        - Each `<think>` block should reflect genuine uncertainty or planning for the NEXT step only\n        - Each tool call should discover information you don't already have\n        - Each result should genuinely influence your next decision\n        - Never write code that \"happens\" to contain the full solution with reasoning in comments\n        - Never create simulated data when real data should be searched for\n        - Break complex tasks into 3-5 distinct tool calls\n        \n        **Your reasoning should be:** \"I need to find X, then based on X I'll do Y, then based on Y I'll conclude Z\"\n        **NOT:** \"I know the answer is Z, let me use tools to demonstrate how to get to Z\"\n\n        **The question is:**\n        \n        🔍 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**\n        \n        **BEFORE YOUR FIRST RESPONSE, ASK YOURSELF:**\n        \n        **🚨 EXECUTION FAILURE PREVENTION:**\n        - Am I about to create a multi-step plan? → STOP! Execute step 1 only\n        - Am I thinking beyond the immediate next action? → STOP! Focus on NOW\n        - Am I outlining what I \"will then do\"? → STOP! Do it immediately instead\n        - Am I creating a methodology or approach? → STOP! Start acting immediately\n        \n        **✅ EXECUTION SUCCESS CHECKLIST:**\n        - [ ] I know exactly ONE concrete action I can take right now\n        - [ ] This action will produce real, observable results\n        - [ ] I am NOT planning what to do after this action\n        - [ ] I am ready to execute immediately, not \"prepare to execute\"\n        \n        **🎯 COMPLEXITY TRIAGE:**\n        - **Simple Task** (weather, stock price, definition): Direct search → Answer\n        - **Complex Task** (research, analysis, multi-part): ONE action now → See results → Repeat\n        \n        **🔥 EMERGENCY EXECUTION PROTOCOL:**\n        If you catch yourself:\n        - Writing \"step 1, step 2, step 3\" → Execute step 1 NOW\n        - Saying \"I need to research X, then Y, then Z\" → Research X NOW\n        - Planning a \"comprehensive analysis\" → Start analyzing what you can NOW\n        - Creating a \"methodology\" → Take the first concrete action NOW\n        \n        **⚡ EXECUTION GUARANTEE:**\n        - Every response MUST contain at least one `<execute_tools />`\n        - No response should end with future plans or intentions\n        - When in doubt: ACTION FIRST, PLANNING LATER\n        - Remember: You can always continue in the next response after seeing results\n        \n        **🆘 SUCCESS PATTERN:**\n        1. `<think>` → What's the ONE thing I can do right now?\n        2. Tool call → Execute that ONE thing\n        3. `<execute_tools />` → Trigger execution\n        4. Wait for results\n        5. REPEAT with next single action\n\n\nUser: 使用Python对一个包含股票数据的CSV文件进行分析：1) 使用web搜索找到最新的苹果公司股票价格信息，2) 创建一个包含历史数据的CSV文件模拟，3) 使用pandas进行数据清洗和分析，4) 计算移动平均线和RSI指标，5) 生成可视化图表，6) 基于分析结果提供投资建议\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nThe user wants to analyze stock data using Python.

✅ **Action Aliases**: You can use 'execute', 'run', 'exec', or 'microsandbox_execute' - all are valid\n          - ✅ **DO**: Small, focused calculations or analysis on data you received from other tools\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Large scripts that simulate data or solve everything at once\n        - 🔧 **Browser**: Use `<browser_use><browser_search_google>your_query</browser_search_google></browser_use>` with proper query format\n          -

**Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        -

✅ **Action Aliases**: You can use 'execute', 'run', 'exec', or 'microsandbox_execute' - all are valid\n          - ✅ **DO**: Small, focused calculations or analysis on data you received from other tools\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Large scripts that simulate data or solve everything at once\n        - 🔧 **Browser**: Use `<browser_use><browser_search_google>your_query</browser_search_google></browser_use>` with proper query format\n          - ✅ **DO**: Search for specific, real information you need\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Use as a formality when you already \"know\" the answer\n        - 🔧 **DeepSearch**: Use `<deepsearch><research>your_question</research></deepsearch>` for research tasks\n          -

**Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        -

✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        -

🔧 **MicroSandbox**: Use `<microsandbox><execute>your_python_code</execute></microsandbox>` or `<microsandbox><microsandbox_execute>your_python_code</microsandbox_execute></microsandbox>`\n          - ✅ **Action Aliases**: You can use 'execute', 'run', 'exec', or 'microsandbox_execute' - all are valid\n          - ✅ **DO**: Small, focused calculations or analysis on data you received from other tools\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Large scripts that simulate data or solve everything at once\n        - 🔧 **Browser**: Use `<browser_use><browser_search_google>your_query</browser_search_google></browser_use>` with proper query format\n          - ✅ **DO**: Search for specific, real information you need\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Use as a formality when you already \"know\" the answer\n        - 🔧 **DeepSearch**: Use `<deepsearch><research>your_question</research></deepsearch>` for research tasks\n          - ✅ **DO**: Genuine research for information you don't have\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Performative research to validate pre-generated answers\n        - 🔄 **Memory Staging**: Use `<memory_staging><memory_write>{\"key\": \"data_name\", \"value\": data}</memory_write></memory_staging>` to solve information silos\n          - ✅ **CRITICAL FOR COMPLEX TASKS**: Save search results, API data, or calculated values for use in subsequent steps\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_write immediately after getting important data from search tools\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        - At least 2 separate tool calls\n        - Each tool call must build on previous results\n        - No single tool call should solve the entire problem\n        - Results from each tool must influence the next step\n\n        3. **Execution Trigger**: You MUST end your tool calls with `<execute_tools />` to signal the system to execute them.\n        4. **Execution Control**:\n            - **Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        - Example: \"What's the weather in Paris?\" → Search → Answer\n        \n        **Complex Tasks (3+ steps)**: MANDATORY step-by-step progression\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Break into distinct phases with separate tool calls\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        -

Each `<think>` block should reflect genuine uncertainty or planning for the NEXT step only\n        - Each tool call should discover information you don't already have\n        - Each result should genuinely influence your next decision\n        - Never write code that \"happens\" to contain the full solution with reasoning in comments\n        - Never create simulated data when real data should be searched for\n        - Break complex tasks into 3-5 distinct tool calls\n        \n        **Your reasoning should be:** \"I need to find X, then based on X I'll do Y, then based on Y I'll conclude Z\"\n        **NOT:** \"I know the answer is Z, let me use tools to demonstrate how to get to Z\"\n\n        **The question is:**\n        \n        🔍 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**\n        \n        **BEFORE YOUR FIRST RESPONSE, ASK YOURSELF:**\n        \n        **🚨 EXECUTION FAILURE PREVENTION:**\n        -

✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        - At least 2 separate tool calls\n        - Each tool call must build on previous results\n        - No single tool call should solve the entire problem\n        - Results from each tool must influence the next step\n\n        3. **Execution Trigger**: You MUST end your tool calls with `<execute_tools />` to signal the system to execute them.\n        4. **Execution Control**:\n            - **Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        - Example: \"What's the weather in Paris?\" → Search → Answer\n        \n        **Complex Tasks (3+ steps)**: MANDATORY step-by-step progression\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Break into distinct phases with separate tool calls\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        - If multiple approaches fail, provide a partial answer based on available information\n        \n        **🚨 FINAL REMINDER: GENUINE STEP-BY-STEP REASONING REQUIRED 🚨**\n        \n        You are an AI that must demonstrate REAL reasoning through tool usage:\n        - Each `<think>` block should reflect genuine uncertainty or planning for the NEXT step only\n        - Each tool call should discover information you don't already have\n        - Each result should genuinely influence your next decision\n        - Never write code that \"happens\" to contain the full solution with reasoning in comments\n        - Never create simulated data when real data should be searched for\n        - Break complex tasks into 3-5 distinct tool calls\n        \n        **Your reasoning should be:** \"I need to find X, then based on X I'll do Y, then based on Y I'll conclude Z\"\n        **NOT:** \"I know the answer is Z, let me use tools to demonstrate how to get to Z\"\n\n        **The question is:**\n        \n        🔍 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**\n        \n        **BEFORE YOUR FIRST RESPONSE, ASK YOURSELF:**\n        \n        **🚨 EXECUTION FAILURE PREVENTION:**\n        -

✅ **Action Aliases**: You can use 'execute', 'run', 'exec', or 'microsandbox_execute' - all are valid\n          - ✅ **DO**: Small, focused calculations or analysis on data you received from other tools\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Large scripts that simulate data or solve everything at once\n        - 🔧 **Browser**: Use `<browser_use><browser_search_google>your_query</browser_search_google></browser_use>` with proper query format\n          -

**Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        -

✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        -

✅ **CRITICAL FOR COMPLEX TASKS**: Save search results, API data, or calculated values for use in subsequent steps\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_write immediately after getting important data from search tools\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        - At least 2 separate tool calls\n        - Each tool call must build on previous results\n        - No single tool call should solve the entire problem\n        - Results from each tool must influence the next step\n\n        3. **Execution Trigger**: You MUST end your tool calls with `<execute_tools />` to signal the system to execute them.\n        4. **Execution Control**:\n            - **Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        - Example: \"What's the weather in Paris?\" → Search → Answer\n        \n        **Complex Tasks (3+ steps)**: MANDATORY step-by-step progression\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Break into distinct phases with separate tool calls\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        - If multiple approaches fail, provide a partial answer based on available information\n        \n        **🚨 FINAL REMINDER: GENUINE STEP-BY-STEP REASONING REQUIRED 🚨**\n        \n        You are an AI that must demonstrate REAL reasoning through tool usage:\n        - Each `<think>` block should reflect genuine uncertainty or planning for the NEXT step only\n        - Each tool call should discover information you don't already have\n        - Each result should genuinely influence your next decision\n        - Never write code that \"happens\" to contain the full solution with reasoning in comments\n        - Never create simulated data when real data should be searched for\n        - Break complex tasks into 3-5 distinct tool calls\n        \n        **Your reasoning should be:** \"I need to find X, then based on X I'll do Y, then based on Y I'll conclude Z\"\n        **NOT:** \"I know the answer is Z, let me use tools to demonstrate how to get to Z\"\n\n        **The question is:**\n        \n        🔍 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**\n        \n        **BEFORE YOUR FIRST RESPONSE, ASK YOURSELF:**\n        \n        **🚨 EXECUTION FAILURE PREVENTION:**\n        -

Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        -

✅ **Action Aliases**: You can use 'execute', 'run', 'exec', or 'microsandbox_execute' - all are valid\n          - ✅ **DO**: Small, focused calculations or analysis on data you received from other tools\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Large scripts that simulate data or solve everything at once\n        - 🔧 **Browser**: Use `<browser_use><browser_search_google>your_query</browser_search_google></browser_use>` with proper query format\n          - ✅ **DO**: Search for specific, real information you need\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Use as a formality when you already \"know\" the answer\n        - 🔧 **DeepSearch**: Use `<deepsearch><research>your_question</research></deepsearch>` for research tasks\n          -

✅ **CRITICAL FOR COMPLEX TASKS**: Save search results, API data, or calculated values for use in subsequent steps\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_write immediately after getting important data from search tools\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        -

**Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        -

✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        -

✅ **Action Aliases**: You can use 'execute', 'run', 'exec', or 'microsandbox_execute' - all are valid\n          - ✅ **DO**: Small, focused calculations or analysis on data you received from other tools\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Large scripts that simulate data or solve everything at once\n        - 🔧 **Browser**: Use `<browser_use><browser_search_google>your_query</browser_search_google></browser_use>` with proper query format\n          - ✅ **DO**: Search for specific, real information you need\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Use as a formality when you already \"know\" the answer\n        - 🔧 **DeepSearch**: Use `<deepsearch><research>your_question</research></deepsearch>` for research tasks\n          - ✅ **DO**: Genuine research for information you don't have\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Performative research to validate pre-generated answers\n        - 🔄 **Memory Staging**: Use `<memory_staging><memory_write>{\"key\": \"data_name\", \"value\": data}</memory_write></memory_staging>` to solve information silos\n          - ✅ **CRITICAL FOR COMPLEX TASKS**: Save search results, API data, or calculated values for use in subsequent steps\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_write immediately after getting important data from search tools\n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        -

**Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        -

✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        -

✅ **DO**: Use memory_read to access previously saved data in Python code or analysis steps  \n          - ✅ **DO**: Use memory_list to see what data is available from previous steps\n          - ❌ **DON'T**: Create simulated data when you should retrieve real data from memory staging\n        \n        **🔥 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n        1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to collect real data/information\n        2. **Processing Phase**: Use 1-2 tool calls to process or analyze the collected data  \n        3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use 1 final tool call if needed for final calculations\n        4. **Answer Phase**: Provide final answer based on ACTUAL tool results\n        \n        **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS:**\n        - At least 2 separate tool calls\n        - Each tool call must build on previous results\n        - No single tool call should solve the entire problem\n        - Results from each tool must influence the next step\n\n        3. **Execution Trigger**: You MUST end your tool calls with `<execute_tools />` to signal the system to execute them.\n        4. **Execution Control**:\n            - **Single Call**: A single tool call block followed by `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Parallel Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<parallel>...</parallel>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n            - **Sequential Calls**: Wrap multiple tool calls in `<sequential>...</sequential>`, then add `<execute_tools />`.\n\n        5. **Task Completion - Use the Protocol Above**: \n           🔒 **REMEMBER**: You MUST follow the Answer Tag Usage Protocol checklist above.\n           🔒 **MANDATORY**: Execute tools first, receive meaningful results, THEN provide answer.\n           🔒 **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `<answer>` for plans, thoughts, or before tool execution.\n           \n        **🎯 TASK COMPLEXITY HANDLING:**\n        \n        **Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: Direct tool use → Answer\n        - Example: \"What's the weather in Paris?\" → Search → Answer\n        \n        **Complex Tasks (3+ steps)**: MANDATORY step-by-step progression\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Break into distinct phases with separate tool calls\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Each phase must genuinely depend on previous results\n        - ✅ **REQUIRED**: Show clear progression from unknown to known\n        - ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Bundling multiple operations into single executions\n        \n        **Research Tasks**: MANDATORY iterative exploration\n        - Step 1: Gather base information\n        - Step 2: Dive deeper based on Step 1 findings\n        - Step 3: Cross-reference or validate findings\n        - Step 4: Synthesize with focused analysis\n        \n        **Analysis Tasks**: MANDATORY data-then-analysis pattern\n        - Step 1: Collect/find real data sources\n        - Step 2: Process the actual data received\n        - Step 3: Generate insights from processed results\n           \n\n        **Error Recovery**:\n        - If a tool call fails with parameter errors, check the EXACT parameter names in the tool definitions above\n        - If a tool times out, try an alternative approach rather than repeating the same call\n        - If multiple approaches fail, provide a partial answer based on available information\n        \n        **🚨 FINAL REMINDER: GENUINE STEP-BY-STEP REASONING REQUIRED 🚨**\n        \n        You are an AI that must demonstrate REAL reasoning through tool usage:\n        - Each `<think>` block should reflect genuine uncertainty or planning for the NEXT step only\n        - Each tool call should discover information you don't already have\n        - Each result should genuinely influence your next decision\n        - Never write code that \"happens\" to contain the full solution with reasoning in comments\n        - Never create simulated data when real data should be searched for\n        - Break complex tasks into 3-5 distinct tool calls\n        \n        **Your reasoning should be:** \"I need to find X, then based on X I'll do Y, then based on Y I'll conclude Z\"\n        **NOT:** \"I know the answer is Z, let me use tools to demonstrate how to get to Z\"\n\n        **The question is:**\n        \n        🔍 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**\n        \n        **BEFORE YOUR FIRST RESPONSE, ASK YOURSELF:**\n        \n        **🚨 EXECUTION FAILURE PREVENTION:**\n        -

Do it immediately instead\n        - Am I creating a methodology or approach? → STOP! Start acting immediately\n        \n        **✅ EXECUTION SUCCESS CHECKLIST:**\n        - [ ] I know exactly ONE concrete action I can take right now\n        - [ ] This action will produce real, observable results\n        - [ ] I am NOT planning what to do after this action\n        - [ ] I am ready to execute immediately, not \"prepare to execute\"\n        \n        **🎯 COMPLEXITY TRIAGE:**\n        - **Simple Task** (weather, stock price, definition): Direct search → Answer\n        - **Complex Task** (research, analysis, multi-part): ONE action now → See results → Repeat\n        \n        **🔥 EMERGENCY EXECUTION PROTOCOL:**\n        If you catch yourself:\n        - Writing \"step 1, step 2, step 3\" → Execute step 1 NOW\n        - Saying \"I need to research X, then Y, then Z\" → Research X NOW\n        - Planning a \"comprehensive analysis\" → Start analyzing what you can NOW\n        - Creating a \"methodology\" → Take the first concrete action NOW\n        \n        **⚡ EXECUTION GUARANTEE:**\n        - Every response MUST contain at least one `<execute_tools />`\n        - No response should end with future plans or intentions\n        - When in doubt: ACTION FIRST, PLANNING LATER\n        - Remember: You can always continue in the next response after seeing results\n        \n        **🆘 SUCCESS PATTERN:**\n        1. `<think>` → What's the ONE thing I can do right now?\n        2. Tool call → Execute that ONE thing\n        3. `<execute_tools />` → Trigger execution\n        4. Wait for results\n        5.

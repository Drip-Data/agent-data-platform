Your primary goal is to efficiently complete the user's task by carefully planning and invoking the correct tools using a strict XML-formatted communication protocol.\n\n## **Workflows**\n\nuser query --> thoughg process --> Tool Parameter Query -->Tool Invocation --> Tool result --> thoughg process --> ... --> Final answer\n\n## **Core Principles & XML Communication Protocol**\n\nAdherence to the following rules and the specified XML format is **mandatory** for successful task execution. Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

Your primary goal is to efficiently complete the user's task by carefully planning and invoking the correct tools using a strict XML-formatted communication protocol.\n\n## **Workflows**\n\nuser query --> thoughg process --> Tool Parameter Query -->Tool Invocation --> Tool result --> thoughg process --> ... --> Final answer\n\n## **Core Principles & XML Communication Protocol**\n\nAdherence to the following rules and the specified XML format is **mandatory** for successful task execution. Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

Your primary goal is to efficiently complete the user's task by carefully planning and invoking the correct tools using a strict XML-formatted communication protocol.\n\n## **Workflows**\n\nuser query --> thoughg process --> Tool Parameter Query -->Tool Invocation --> Tool result --> thoughg process --> ... --> Final answer\n\n## **Core Principles & XML Communication Protocol**\n\nAdherence to the following rules and the specified XML format is **mandatory** for successful task execution. Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

Your primary goal is to efficiently complete the user's task by carefully planning and invoking the correct tools using a strict XML-formatted communication protocol.\n\n## **Workflows**\n\nuser query --> thoughg process --> Tool Parameter Query -->Tool Invocation --> Tool result --> thoughg process --> ... --> Final answer\n\n## **Core Principles & XML Communication Protocol**\n\nAdherence to the following rules and the specified XML format is **mandatory** for successful task execution. Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

Your primary goal is to efficiently complete the user's task by carefully planning and invoking the correct tools using a strict XML-formatted communication protocol.\n\n## **Workflows**\n\nuser query --> thoughg process --> Tool Parameter Query -->Tool Invocation --> Tool result --> thoughg process --> ... --> Final answer\n\n## **Core Principles & XML Communication Protocol**\n\nAdherence to the following rules and the specified XML format is **mandatory** for successful task execution. Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

Your primary goal is to efficiently complete the user's task by carefully planning and invoking the correct tools using a strict XML-formatted communication protocol.\n\n## **Workflows**\n\nuser query --> thoughg process --> Tool Parameter Query -->Tool Invocation --> Tool result --> thoughg process --> ... --> Final answer\n\n## **Core Principles & XML Communication Protocol**\n\nAdherence to the following rules and the specified XML format is **mandatory** for successful task execution. Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

Your primary goal is to efficiently complete the user's task by carefully planning and invoking the correct tools using a strict XML-formatted communication protocol.\n\n## **Workflows**\n\nuser query --> thoughg process --> Tool Parameter Query -->Tool Invocation --> Tool result --> thoughg process --> ... --> Final answer\n\n## **Core Principles & XML Communication Protocol**\n\nAdherence to the following rules and the specified XML format is **mandatory** for successful task execution. Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

Your primary goal is to efficiently complete the user's task by carefully planning and invoking the correct tools using a strict XML-formatted communication protocol.\n\n## **Workflows**\n\nuser query --> thoughg process --> Tool Parameter Query -->Tool Invocation --> Tool result --> thoughg process --> ... --> Final answer\n\n## **Core Principles & XML Communication Protocol**\n\nAdherence to the following rules and the specified XML format is **mandatory** for successful task execution. Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

If a person violates traffic management regulations and causes a major accident, resulting in serious injury to persons or significant losses of property, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. If the accident results in death, or is particularly serious, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than seven years.\n\nDrunk driving itself is a separate offense under Article 133-bis of the Criminal Law, classified as \"Crime of Dangerous Driving.\" However, when drunk driving leads to a traffic accident with severe consequences, the more encompassing charge that reflects the outcome is often \"Crime of Causing a Traffic Accident.\"\n\nConsidering the options provided:\nA. Negligent homicide: This is generally for situations where death is caused by negligence, but not necessarily in a traffic context with specific drunk driving elements.\nB. Dangerous driving: This covers drunk driving, but the scenario also includes the consequences of the accident (serious injury and death).\nC.

If a person violates traffic management regulations and causes a major accident, resulting in serious injury to persons or significant losses of property, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. If the accident results in death, or is particularly serious, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than seven years.\n\nDrunk driving itself is a separate offense under Article 133-bis of the Criminal Law, classified as \"Crime of Dangerous Driving.\" However, when drunk driving leads to a traffic accident with severe consequences, the more encompassing charge that reflects the outcome is often \"Crime of Causing a Traffic Accident.\"\n\nConsidering the options provided:\nA. Negligent homicide: This is generally for situations where death is caused by negligence, but not necessarily in a traffic context with specific drunk driving elements.\nB. Dangerous driving: This covers drunk driving, but the scenario also includes the consequences of the accident (serious injury and death).\nC. Traffic accident crime: This aligns well with the scenario where a traffic violation (drunk driving) leads to an accident with severe consequences.\nD. Reckless endangerment offense: While drunk driving is reckless, this is a broader category and \"traffic accident crime\" is more specific to the situation.\nE. Non-intentional vehicular homicide: This is a descriptive term, but \"Traffic accident crime\" is the legal classification in China for such scenarios.\n\nGiven that the conduct involves drunk driving *and* causing a traffic accident with serious injury and death, the most fitting legal classification among the choices, reflecting the direct outcome of the traffic violation, is **Traffic accident crime**. The act of drunk driving is a violation of traffic regulations that directly led to the accident and its severe consequences.\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe research result indicates that the crime committed is typically \"Crime of Causing a Traffic Accident\" (交通肇事罪) when drunk driving leads to serious injury or death. The provided options include \"Traffic accident crime\" (C). The other options are either too general or not the most precise legal term for this specific scenario under Chinese law as described in the research. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.\n</think>\n<answer>\nUnder Chinese law, A's conduct constitutes **C. Traffic accident crime**. This is because the act of driving under the influence of alcohol, which is a violation of traffic regulations, directly led to a traffic accident resulting in one person being seriously injured and another person dying.

If a person violates traffic management regulations and causes a major accident, resulting in serious injury to persons or significant losses of property, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. If the accident results in death, or is particularly serious, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than seven years.\n\nDrunk driving itself is a separate offense under Article 133-bis of the Criminal Law, classified as \"Crime of Dangerous Driving.\" However, when drunk driving leads to a traffic accident with severe consequences, the more encompassing charge that reflects the outcome is often \"Crime of Causing a Traffic Accident.\"\n\nConsidering the options provided:\nA. Negligent homicide: This is generally for situations where death is caused by negligence, but not necessarily in a traffic context with specific drunk driving elements.\nB.

Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.\n</think>\n<answer>\nUnder Chinese law, A's conduct constitutes **C. Traffic accident crime**. This is because the act of driving under the influence of alcohol, which is a violation of traffic regulations, directly led to a traffic accident resulting in one person being seriously injured and another person dying. While drunk driving itself is a crime (Dangerous Driving), when it results in severe consequences like death or serious injury due to an accident, the more encompassing charge that reflects the outcome is the Crime of Causing a Traffic Accident.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<result>{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"tool_id\": \"deepsearch\",\n  \"action\": \"quick_research\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"question\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"快速研究问题\",\n      \"required\": true\n    }\n  },\n  \"example\": {\n    \"question\": \"machine learning basics\"\n  }\n}</result>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<result>No executable action detected in this step.

Your primary goal is to efficiently complete the user's task by carefully planning and invoking the correct tools using a strict XML-formatted communication protocol.\n\n## **Workflows**\n\nuser query --> thoughg process --> Tool Parameter Query -->Tool Invocation --> Tool result --> thoughg process --> ... --> Final answer\n\n## **Core Principles & XML Communication Protocol**\n\nAdherence to the following rules and the specified XML format is **mandatory** for successful task execution. Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

If a person violates traffic management regulations and causes a major accident, resulting in serious injury to persons or significant losses of property, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. If the accident results in death, or is particularly serious, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than seven years.\n\nDrunk driving itself is a separate offense under Article 133-bis of the Criminal Law, classified as \"Crime of Dangerous Driving.\" However, when drunk driving leads to a traffic accident with severe consequences, the more encompassing charge that reflects the outcome is often \"Crime of Causing a Traffic Accident.\"\n\nConsidering the options provided:\nA. Negligent homicide: This is generally for situations where death is caused by negligence, but not necessarily in a traffic context with specific drunk driving elements.\nB. Dangerous driving: This covers drunk driving, but the scenario also includes the consequences of the accident (serious injury and death).\nC. Traffic accident crime: This aligns well with the scenario where a traffic violation (drunk driving) leads to an accident with severe consequences.\nD. Reckless endangerment offense: While drunk driving is reckless, this is a broader category and \"traffic accident crime\" is more specific to the situation.\nE. Non-intentional vehicular homicide: This is a descriptive term, but \"Traffic accident crime\" is the legal classification in China for such scenarios.\n\nGiven that the conduct involves drunk driving *and* causing a traffic accident with serious injury and death, the most fitting legal classification among the choices, reflecting the direct outcome of the traffic violation, is **Traffic accident crime**. The act of drunk driving is a violation of traffic regulations that directly led to the accident and its severe consequences.\n</result>\n\n<think>\nThe research result indicates that the crime committed is typically \"Crime of Causing a Traffic Accident\" (交通肇事罪) when drunk driving leads to serious injury or death. The provided options include \"Traffic accident crime\" (C). The other options are either too general or not the most precise legal term for this specific scenario under Chinese law as described in the research. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.\n</think>\n<answer>\nUnder Chinese law, A's conduct constitutes **C. Traffic accident crime**. This is because the act of driving under the influence of alcohol, which is a violation of traffic regulations, directly led to a traffic accident resulting in one person being seriously injured and another person dying. While drunk driving itself is a crime (Dangerous Driving), when it results in severe consequences like death or serious injury due to an accident, the more encompassing charge that reflects the outcome is the Crime of Causing a Traffic Accident.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<result>{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"tool_id\": \"deepsearch\",\n  \"action\": \"quick_research\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"question\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"快速研究问题\",\n      \"required\": true\n    }\n  },\n  \"example\": {\n    \"question\": \"machine learning basics\"\n  }\n}</result>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<result>No executable action detected in this step.

Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

Dangerous driving**. This is because the scenario involves driving under the influence of alcohol, violating traffic regulations by entering a restricted area, and causing an accident that resulted in serious injury and death. Chinese law, specifically Article 133-bis of the Criminal Law, criminalizes such acts as dangerous driving, especially when they lead to severe consequences like those described.\n\n<answer>The search results provide information about drunk driving laws in China. Several sources mention that drunk driving causing serious injury or death is a serious offense. Specifically, the \"Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China\" is referenced. Article 133-bis (added in 2011) deals with crimes of dangerous driving. It states that whoever drives a motor vehicle in violation of traffic regulations, thereby causing a major accident resulting in serious injury or death to a person or heavy losses to public or private property, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. If the circumstances are particularly bad, the sentence shall be fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than seven years.\n\nThe scenario describes A driving under the influence, failing to notice a restricted area, causing the vehicle to fall, resulting in serious injury and death. This clearly falls under dangerous driving that leads to severe consequences.\n\nLet's analyze the options provided:\nA. Negligent homicide: This usually involves a lack of due care, but the context of drunk driving and causing a traffic accident points to a more specific offense.\nB. Dangerous driving: This aligns with the description of driving in violation of traffic regulations (implied by drunk driving and entering a restricted area) and causing a major accident.\nC. Traffic accident crime: This is a broader category, and dangerous driving is a specific type of traffic accident crime.\nD. Reckless endangerment offense: While drunk driving is reckless, the direct consequence of injury and death makes \"dangerous driving\" or \"traffic accident crime\" more precise.\nE. Non-intentional vehicular homicide: This is similar to negligent homicide but specifically for vehicular incidents.\n\nGiven the details of drunk driving, causing an accident, serious injury, and death, the most fitting crime under Chinese law, as indicated by the search results, is \"dangerous driving\" which encompasses these elements and leads to severe penalties. The specific article mentioned (133-bis) directly addresses such conduct. The question asks what crime A's conduct constitutes, and \"dangerous driving\" is the most direct and specific charge for this type of offense in China.", "steps": [{"step_index": 0, "step_start_time": "2025-07-11T20:21:24.395734", "step_end_time": "2025-07-11T20:21:27.279913", "step_duration_seconds": 2.884, "llm_interaction": {"llm_call_start_time": "2025-07-11T20:21:24.892865", "llm_call_end_time": "2025-07-11T20:21:26.372845", "llm_call_duration_seconds": 1.48, "prompt_sent_to_llm": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert AI assistant designed to meticulously solve user tasks by thinking step-by-step and leveraging available services.

Your primary goal is to efficiently complete the user's task by carefully planning and invoking the correct tools using a strict XML-formatted communication protocol.\n\n## **Workflows**\n\nuser query --> thoughg process --> Tool Parameter Query -->Tool Invocation --> Tool result --> thoughg process --> ... --> Final answer\n\n## **Core Principles & XML Communication Protocol**\n\nAdherence to the following rules and the specified XML format is **mandatory** for successful task execution. Each step in your process will involve one of these actions:\n\n1.  **Reasoning**: Articulate your thought process and action plan.\n    ```xml\n    <think>Your detailed thinking process and plan for the current step.</think>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Parameter Query**: If you are unsure about a tool's required parameters, query the system for its schema. **Do not guess parameters.**\n    ```xml\n    <tool_param>\n      <tool_id>service_name</tool_id>\n      <action>tool_name</action>\n    </tool_param>\n    ```\n    Upon execution, this will return a `<result>` block containing the necessary parameter schema.\n\n3.  **Tool Invocation**: Once you have the parameter schema, construct and invoke the tool call. **Service names and tool names must match system definitions precisely.** The parameter structure must strictly adhere to the returned JSON schema.\n    ```xml\n    <service_name>\n      <tool_name>{\"parameter1\": \"value\", \"parameter2\": \"value\", ...}</tool_name>\n    </service_name>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Tool Execution Trigger**: After defining your tool calls, trigger their execution. The backend will then process them and return a new `<result>` block containing the output.\n    ```xml\n    <execute_tools />\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: When the task is complete and you have derived the definitive solution based on tool outputs and your reasoning, wrap your final answer. **Do not output the `<answer>` tag prematurely.**\n    ```xml\n    <answer>\\boxed{Your final answer here}</answer>\n    ```\n\n---\n## **Available Services**\n\nThe following services and tools are available for your use:\n\nHere are the available services and their tools.

<think>The user wants to construct a degree 19 polynomial $p(x)$ with specific properties and then calculate $p(19)$.

Here's a breakdown of the requirements for $p(x)$:
1.  **Degree 19**: The highest power of $x$ is 19.
2.  **$p(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x]$**: The coefficients are complex numbers.
3.  **$X := \{ (x, y) \in P^1 \times P^1 \mid p(x) = p(y) \}$ has at least 3 irreducible components over $\mathbb{C}$**: This is the most complex condition. The set $X$ is an algebraic variety. The condition $p(x) = p(y)$ defines a subvariety. The structure of this subvariety depends on the roots of $p(x)$.
4.  **$p(x)$ is odd**: $p(-x) = -p(x)$. This implies that $p(x)$ only has odd powers of $x$.
5.  **$p(x)$ is monic**: The leading coefficient is 1.
6.  **$p(x)$ has real coefficients**: The coefficients are real numbers.
7.  **Linear coefficient is -19**: The coefficient of $x$ is -19.
8.  **Calculate $p(19)$**: Evaluate the constructed polynomial at $x=19$.

Let's address these conditions step-by-step.

**Condition 4 & 5 & 6 & 7: Constructing the polynomial structure**
Since $p(x)$ is odd and has degree 19, it can only have odd powers of $x$.
$p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3x^3 + a_1x + a_0$.
Since it's odd, $a_0 = 0$.
The linear coefficient is -19, so $a_1 = -19$.
The coefficients are real, so $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$ for all $i$.
The polynomial is monic, so the coefficient of $x^{19}$ is 1.

So, $p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3x^3 - 19x$.

**Condition 3: The variety $X$**
The condition $p(x) = p(y)$ defines the set $X$.
$p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
Let $p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{19} c_k x^k$.
$p(x) - p(y) = \sum_{k=0}^{19} c_k (x^k - y^k)$.
We know that $x^k - y^k = (x-y)(x^{k-1} + x^{k-2}y + \dots + y^{k-1})$.
So, $p(x) - p(y) = (x-y) \sum_{k=1}^{19} c_k (x^{k-1} + x^{k-2}y + \dots + y^{k-1})$.
Let $q(x, y) = \sum_{k=1}^{19} c_k (x^{k-1} + x^{k-2}y + \dots + y^{k-1})$.
Then $p(x) - p(y) = (x-y) q(x, y)$.

The set $X$ is the zero locus of $(x-y)q(x,y)$ in $P^1 \times P^1$.
The components of $X$ are the zero loci of $x-y$ and $q(x,y)$.

The zero locus of $x-y$ in $P^1 \times P^1$ is the diagonal, which is an irreducible component. This component is isomorphic to $P^1$.

Now consider the components arising from $q(x, y) = 0$.
$q(x, y) = \sum_{k=1}^{19} c_k \frac{x^k - y^k}{x-y}$.
Since $p(x)$ is odd, $c_k = 0$ for even $k$.
$p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3x^3 - 19x$.
$q(x, y) = (x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}) + a_{17}(x^{16} + \dots + y^{16}) + \dots + a_3(x^2 + xy + y^2) - 19$.

We need at least 3 irreducible components. One is the diagonal $x=y$. So we need at least two more components from $q(x,y)=0$.

Let's consider the roots of $p(x)$. Let $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_{19}$ be the roots of $p(x)$.
$p(x) = (x-r_1)(x-r_2)\dots(x-r_{19})$.
The condition $p(x) = p(y)$ means that $y$ is a root of the polynomial $p(z) - p(x) = 0$ (where $z$ is the variable).
For a fixed $x$, $p(y) = p(x)$ means $y$ takes values such that $p(y)$ equals the specific value $p(x)$.
If $p(x)$ has distinct roots $r_1, \dots, r_{19}$, then $p(y) = p(x)$ implies $y \in \{r_1, \dots, r_{19}\}$.
However, this is not quite right for $P^1 \times P^1$.

Let's analyze $q(x,y)$.
$q(x,y) = \frac{p(x)-p(y)}{x-y}$.
If $p(x) = c$ for some constant $c$, then $p(x)=p(y)$ is always true, giving $P^1 \times P^1$ as a component. But $p(x)$ is degree 19.

Consider the case where $p(x)$ has multiple roots.
If $p(r) = 0$ and $p'(r) = 0$, then $p(x) = (x-r)^2 s(x)$.
Then $p(x) - p(y) = (x-r)^2 s(x) - (y-r)^2 s(y)$.
This doesn't simplify nicely.

Let's consider the structure of $q(x,y)$.
$q(x,y) = \frac{p(x)-p(y)}{x-y}$.
If $p(x) = x^n$, then $q(x,y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \dots + y^{n-1}$.
If $n$ is odd, $n=19$.
$p(x) = x^{19}$. $p(x)=p(y) \implies x^{19}=y^{19}$.
The solutions in $P^1 \times P^1$ are $(x,y)$ such that $x^{19} = y^{19}$.
Let $x = [X:Y]$ and $y = [X':Y']$.
$X^{19}Y'^{19} = X'^{19}Y^{19}$.
This defines a variety.
The components are $x=y$ (diagonal), and $x = \omega^k y$ for $\omega$ a primitive 19th root of unity, and $k=1, \dots, 18$.
This gives 19 components.
$p(x) = x^{19}$ is odd, monic, real coefficients (only 1), but linear coefficient is 0, not -19.

We need to modify $p(x)$ to have the linear coefficient -19 and ensure at least 3 components.
The condition $p(x) = p(y)$ means that $y$ is a root of the polynomial $P_x(z) = p(z) - p(x)$.
If $p(x)$ has $d$ distinct roots, then for a generic $x$, $p(x)$ takes a value $c$ that is not a critical value. Then $p(z)=c$ has $d$ distinct roots.
The set $X$ is the union of the graphs of the functions $y = f_i(x)$ where $p(f_i(x)) = p(x)$.

Let's consider the structure of $q(x,y)$.
$q(x,y) = \frac{p(x)-p(y)}{x-y}$.
If $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x$, then $p(x)$ is odd, monic, real coefficients, linear coefficient -19.
$p'(x) = 19x^{18} - 19 = 19(x^{18}-1)$.
The critical points are $x = \pm 1$.
$p(1) = 1 - 19 = -18$.
$p(-1) = -1 - 19(-1) = -1 + 19 = 18$.

The equation $p(x) = p(y)$ is $x^{19} - 19x = y^{19} - 19y$.
$x^{19} - y^{19} - 19(x-y) = 0$.
$(x-y)(x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}) - 19(x-y) = 0$.
$(x-y) [ (x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}) - 19 ] = 0$.

So the components are $x=y$ and $x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18} - 19 = 0$.
Let $Q(x,y) = x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18} - 19$.
This is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 18.
The zero locus of $Q(x,y)$ in $P^1 \times P^1$ is an irreducible component.
This is because $Q(x,y)$ is irreducible. We can see this by setting $y=1$.
$Q(x,1) = x^{18} + x^{17} + \dots + x + 1 - 19 = x^{18} + x^{17} + \dots + x - 18$.
This is a polynomial of degree 18. If it were reducible, it would factor into polynomials of lower degree.

So, with $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x$, we have two components: $x=y$ and $Q(x,y)=0$.
We need at least 3 irreducible components.

How can we get more components?
This happens when $p(x)$ has multiple roots, or when the equation $q(x,y)=0$ splits into multiple irreducible components.

Consider $p(x) = x^{19} + ax^{17} + bx^{15} + \dots - 19x$.
The condition $p(x)=p(y)$ leads to $(x-y)q(x,y)=0$.
$q(x,y) = \frac{p(x)-p(y)}{x-y}$.
If $p(x)$ has roots $r_1, \dots, r_{19}$, then $p(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{19} (x-r_i)$.
$p(x) = p(y) \implies \prod_{i=1}^{19} (x-r_i) = \prod_{i=1}^{19} (y-r_i)$.

Let's try to construct $p(x)$ such that $q(x,y)=0$ splits.
If $p(x)$ has roots $r_1, \dots, r_{19}$, and $p(x)=p(y)$, then $y$ must be one of the roots of $p(z)-p(x)=0$.

Consider the case where $p(x)$ has roots such that $p(r_i) = p(r_j)$ for $i \neq j$.
Since $p(x)$ is odd, if $r$ is a root, then $p(r)=0$.
$p(-r) = -p(r) = 0$. So if $r$ is a root, $-r$ is also a root.
The roots come in pairs $(r, -r)$. Since the degree is 19 (odd), one root must be 0.
$p(0) = 0$.
So the roots are $0, r_1, -r_1, r_2, -r_2, \dots, r_9, -r_9$.
$p(x) = x \prod_{i=1}^9 (x-r_i)(x+r_i) = x \prod_{i=1}^9 (x^2 - r_i^2)$.
Let $s_i = r_i^2$. Since coefficients are real, if $r_i$ is complex, then $\bar{r_i}$ is also a root.
If $r_i$ is real, then $-r_i$ is also real.
If $r_i$ is purely imaginary, $r_i = ib$, then $-r_i = -ib$. $r_i^2 = -b^2$.
If $r_i = a+ib$, then $-r_i = -a-ib$. $\bar{r_i} = a-ib$. $-\bar{r_i} = -a+ib$.
The roots are $0, r_1, -r_1, \dots, r_9, -r_9$.
If $r_i$ is a root, $-r_i$ is a root.
If $r_i$ is a root, $\bar{r_i}$ is a root.
If $r_i$ is a root, $-\bar{r_i}$ is a root.

Let's try to make $p(x)$ have specific properties that lead to multiple components in $q(x,y)=0$.
If $p(x)$ has roots $r_1, \dots, r_{19}$.
$p(x) = p(y) \implies \prod (x-r_i) = \prod (y-r_i)$.

Consider the case where $p(x)$ has roots such that $p(r_i) = c$ for multiple $r_i$.
If $p(x)$ has a root $r$ with multiplicity $m > 1$, then $p(r)=0$ and $p'(r)=0$.
$p'(x) = 19x^{18} + 17a_{17}x^{16} + \dots + 3a_3x^2 - 19$.
If $p'(r)=0$, then $19r^{18} + 17a_{17}r^{16} + \dots + 3a_3r^2 = 19$.

Let's try to construct $p(x)$ by choosing its roots strategically.
We need $p(x)$ to be odd, monic, real coefficients, degree 19, linear coefficient -19.
$p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3x^3 - 19x$.

Consider the structure of $q(x,y) = \frac{p(x)-p(y)}{x-y}$.
If $p(x) = x^n$, $q(x,y) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.
If $n$ is odd, $n=19$.
$q(x,y) = x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}$.
The roots of $q(x,y)=0$ in $P^1$ (setting $y=1$) are the roots of $x^{18} + x^{17} + \dots + x + 1 = 0$.
This is $\frac{x^{19}-1}{x-1} = 0$. The roots are the 19th roots of unity, except for 1.
These are $e^{2\pi i k / 19}$ for $k=1, \dots, 18$.
These are 18 distinct roots.
So $q(x,y)=0$ factors into 18 linear components of the form $x - \omega^k y = 0$, where $\omega$ is a primitive 19th root of unity.
This gives 19 components in total ($x=y$ and the 18 others).

We need to modify $p(x)$ to have the linear coefficient -19 and ensure at least 3 components.
The problem states "at least 3 (but not all linear) irreducible components".
This means some components might not be of the form $x = \omega y$.

Let's go back to $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x

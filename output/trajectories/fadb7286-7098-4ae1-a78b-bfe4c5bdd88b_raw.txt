<think>The user wants to construct a degree 19 polynomial $p(x)$ with specific properties and then calculate $p(19)$.

Here's a breakdown of the requirements for $p(x)$:
1.  **Degree 19**: The highest power of $x$ is 19.
2.  **$p(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x]$**: The coefficients can be complex numbers.
3.  **$X := \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1 \mid p(x) = p(y) \}$ has at least 3 irreducible components over $\mathbb{C}$**: This is the core algebraic geometry part. The set $X$ is a subvariety of $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. The condition $p(x) = p(y)$ defines a relation between $x$ and $y$.
4.  **$p(x)$ is odd**: $p(-x) = -p(x)$. This means $p(x)$ only has odd powers of $x$.
5.  **$p(x)$ is monic**: The leading coefficient (coefficient of $x^{19}$) is 1.
6.  **$p(x)$ has real coefficients**: All coefficients are real numbers.
7.  **Linear coefficient is -19**: The coefficient of $x$ is -19.
8.  **Calculate $p(19)$**: The final numerical value.

Let's address these requirements step-by-step.

**Requirement 4 & 5 & 6 & 7: Constructing $p(x)$**
Since $p(x)$ is odd, it can only have terms of the form $a_k x^k$ where $k$ is odd.
The degree is 19, so the highest term is $x^{19}$ (monic).
The linear coefficient is -19.
So, $p(x)$ will be of the form:
$p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3 x^3 - 19x$.
All $a_k$ must be real.

**Requirement 3: Irreducible Components of $X = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1 \mid p(x) = p(y) \}$**
The set $X$ is defined by the equation $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
Let's consider the structure of this equation.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
Since $p(x)$ is a polynomial, $p(x) - p(y)$ is a polynomial in two variables $x$ and $y$.
The variety $X$ is the zero locus of this polynomial.

Consider the case where $p(x) = c$ for some constant $c$. This would mean $p(x)$ is a constant polynomial, which contradicts the degree 19 requirement.

If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
We know that $y=x$ is always a solution, so the line $y=x$ in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ is an irreducible component of $X$. This gives us one component.

For $p(x)$ to have at least 3 irreducible components, we need more solutions to $p(x) = p(y)$ beyond $y=x$.
Since $p(x)$ is odd, $p(-x) = -p(x)$.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $p(-x) = -p(x) = -p(y)$.
This doesn't directly give us new components.

Let's think about the structure of $p(x) - p(y)$.
$p(x) - p(y) = (x^{19} - y^{19}) + a_{17}(x^{17} - y^{17}) + \dots + a_3(x^3 - y^3) - 19(x - y)$.
We can factor out $(x-y)$ from each term:
$x^k - y^k = (x-y)(x^{k-1} + x^{k-2}y + \dots + y^{k-1})$.
So, $p(x) - p(y) = (x-y) Q(x, y)$, where $Q(x, y)$ is a polynomial.
The components of $X$ are the component $x=y$ and the components defined by $Q(x, y) = 0$.

We need $Q(x, y) = 0$ to have at least two irreducible components.
The degree of $p(x)$ is $n=19$.
The equation $p(x) = p(y)$ defines a curve in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$.
The total degree of the equation $p(x) - p(y) = 0$ in homogeneous coordinates is $n=19$.
The line $x=y$ corresponds to the diagonal in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$.

Let's consider the properties of $p(x)$. Since $p(x)$ is odd, $p(0)=0$.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, and $p$ is injective on some domain, then $x=y$.
However, $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 19, so it's not injective. It will take on values multiple times.

Consider the case where $p(x) = x^3$. Then $x^3 = y^3$.
This gives $x^3 - y^3 = (x-y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) = 0$.
The components are $x=y$ and $x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0$.
The equation $x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0$ in projective coordinates $X/Z, Y/Z$ becomes $(X/Z)^2 + (X/Z)(Y/Z) + (Y/Z)^2 = 0$, which is $X^2 + XY + Y^2 = 0$.
This is a quadratic form. Over $\mathbb{C}$, a quadratic form $aX^2 + bXY + cY^2 = 0$ can be factored into two linear factors if the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac$ is non-zero.
For $X^2 + XY + Y^2 = 0$, the discriminant is $1^2 - 4(1)(1) = -3 \neq 0$.
So, $X^2 + XY + Y^2 = 0$ factors into two distinct linear factors over $\mathbb{C}$.
Let these factors be $L_1(X, Y) = 0$ and $L_2(X, Y) = 0$.
These correspond to two lines in $\mathbb{P}^1$.
So, for $p(x) = x^3$, the components of $X$ are $x=y$, $L_1(x,y)=0$, and $L_2(x,y)=0$. This gives 3 components.

We need a degree 19 polynomial.
Let's try to construct $p(x)$ such that $p(x) = p(y)$ has more solutions.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
Since $p$ is odd, $p(x) = \sum_{k \text{ odd}} a_k x^k$.
$p(x) - p(y) = \sum_{k \text{ odd}} a_k (x^k - y^k)$.
$x^k - y^k = (x-y) \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x^{k-1-i} y^i$.

Consider the structure of the equation $p(x) = p(y)$.
If $p(x) = c$, then $p(x) = p(y)$ for all $x, y$. This is not useful.

Let's consider the derivative of $p(x)$. $p'(x) = 19x^{18} + \dots - 19$.
If $p'(x) = 0$ for some $x$, then $p(x)$ has a critical point.
If $p(x_0) = p(y_0)$ and $x_0 \neq y_0$, then $p(x) - p(y)$ has factors other than $x-y$.

Let's try to make $p(x)$ have a specific structure that leads to multiple roots for $p(x) = c$.
Consider $p(x) = x^{19}$. Then $x^{19} = y^{19}$.
This means $y = \omega x$, where $\omega$ is a 19th root of unity.
The solutions are $y = x, \omega x, \omega^2 x, \dots, \omega^{18} x$.
These correspond to 19 lines in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$.
So $p(x) = x^{19}$ has 19 components. This satisfies the condition of having at least 3.

However, $p(x) = x^{19}$ does not satisfy the linear coefficient requirement (-19).
We need $p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3 x^3 - 19x$.

Let's consider the structure of $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
If we can choose coefficients such that $p(x) = p(y)$ has solutions of the form $y = \alpha x$ for some $\alpha \neq 1$.
If $y = \alpha x$, then $p(\alpha x) = p(x)$.
$\sum a_k (\alpha x)^k = \sum a_k x^k$
$\sum a_k \alpha^k x^k = \sum a_k x^k$
$\sum a_k (\alpha^k - 1) x^k = 0$ for all $x$.
This implies $a_k (\alpha^k - 1) = 0$ for all $k$.
If $\alpha \neq 1$, then we need $a_k = 0$ for all $k$ such that $\alpha^k \neq 1$.
This means $p(x)$ must be of the form $c x^m$ where $m$ is such that $\alpha^m = 1$.
This is not general enough.

Let's consider the condition that $p(x)$ is odd.
$p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3 x^3 - 19x$.
The equation $p(x) = p(y)$ can be written as:
$x^{19} - y^{19} + a_{17}(x^{17} - y^{17}) + \dots + a_3(x^3 - y^3) - 19(x - y) = 0$.

Consider the case where $p(x) = x^n$. Then $x^n = y^n$. The solutions are $y = \omega x$ where $\omega^n = 1$. This gives $n$ components.
For $n=19$, we get 19 components.

We need at least 3 irreducible components, but not all linear.
The components are of the form $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
If $p(x) = c$, then $p(x) = p(y)$ is the whole space $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$, which is reducible.

Let's consider the structure of $p(x) - p(y)$.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
We know $x=y$ is one component.
If $p(x) = p(-x)$, this would imply $p(x)$ is even, which is not the case.

Let's try to construct $p(x)$ such that $p(x) = p(y)$ has solutions of the form $y = f(x)$ where $f(x)$ is not linear.
Consider $p(x) = x^3$. $x^3 = y^3 \implies y = x, \omega x, \omega^2 x$. These are 3 components.
The polynomial $x^3$ is odd, monic, but its linear coefficient is 0.

We need the linear coefficient to be -19.
Let's try to construct $p(x)$ by adding terms to $x^{19}$ such that the odd property is maintained and the linear coefficient is -19.
$p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3 x^3 - 19x$.

Consider the structure of $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
If we can choose coefficients such that $p(x) = c$ has multiple solutions.
Let $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x$. This is odd, monic, degree 19, linear coefficient -19.
Then $x^{19} - 19x = y^{19} - 19y$.
$x^{19} - y^{19} - 19(x - y) = 0$.
$(x-y)(x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}) - 19(x-y) = 0$.
$(x-y) [ (x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}) - 19 ] = 0$.
So, the components are $x=y$ and $x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18} - 19 = 0$.

Let $S(x, y) = x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}$.
The equation is $S(x, y) - 19 = 0$.
This is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 18.
Over $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$, this equation defines a curve.
The degree of this curve is 18.
The number of irreducible components of $S(x, y) - 19 = 0$ needs to be determined.
If $S(x, y) - 19$ is irreducible, then we have 2 components ($x=y$ and $S(x,y)-19=0$). This is not enough.

We need $S(x, y) - 19$ to factor into at least two irreducible components.
Consider the case where $y = \alpha x$.
$S(x, \alpha x) = x^{18} + x^{17}(\alpha x) + \dots + (\alpha x)^{18}$
$S(x, \alpha x) = x^{18} (1 + \alpha + \alpha^2 + \dots + \alpha^{18})$.
If $S(x, \alpha x) - 19 = 0$, then $x^{18} (1 + \alpha + \dots + \alpha^{18}) - 19 = 0$.
This requires $1 + \alpha + \dots + \alpha^{18} = 0$ and $-19 = 0$, which is impossible.

Let's consider the structure of $p(x) = p(y)$ more generally.
If $p(x) = c$, then $p(x) = p(y)$ for all $x, y$.
If $p(x) = p(y)$ has solutions $y = f_i(x)$, then these define components.

Consider the properties of odd polynomials.
If $p(x)$ is odd, then $p(x) = x \cdot q(x^2)$ for some polynomial $q$.
$p(x) = x(x^{18} + a_{17}x^{16} + \dots + a_3 x^2 - 19)$.
Let $q(t) = t^9 + a_{17}t^8 + \dots + a_3 t - 19$.
So $p(x) = x q(x^2)$.

The equation $p(x) = p(y)$ becomes $x q(x^2) = y q(y^2)$.

If $p(x) = x^n$, then $x^n = y^n$. Components are $y = \omega x$ where $\omega^n = 1$.
If $n=19$, we have 19 components.

We need at least 3 irreducible components, but not all linear.
This means that the equation $p(x) = p(y)$ should have some solutions that are not of the form $y = \alpha x$.

Let's consider the structure of $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
We know $x=y$ is a component.
If $p(x) = c$, then $p(x) = p(y)$ for all $x, y$.

Consider the case where $p(x) =

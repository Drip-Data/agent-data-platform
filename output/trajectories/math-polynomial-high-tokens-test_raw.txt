<think>The user wants me to construct a degree 19 polynomial $p(x)$ with specific properties and then calculate $p(19)$.

Here's a breakdown of the requirements for $p(x)$:
1.  **Degree 19**: The highest power of $x$ is 19.
2.  **$p(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x]$**: The coefficients are complex numbers.
3.  **$X := \{ (x, y) \in P^1 \times P^1 \mid p(x) = p(y) \}$ has at least 3 irreducible components over $\mathbb{C}$**: This is the most complex condition. The set $X$ is a subvariety of $P^1 \times P^1$. The equation $p(x) = p(y)$ defines a relation between two points $x$ and $y$ on the projective line.
4.  **$p(x)$ is odd**: $p(-x) = -p(x)$. This implies that $p(x)$ only has odd powers of $x$.
5.  **$p(x)$ is monic**: The leading coefficient (coefficient of $x^{19}$) is 1.
6.  **$p(x)$ has real coefficients**: All coefficients are real numbers.
7.  **Linear coefficient is -19**: The coefficient of $x$ is -19.
8.  **Calculate $p(19)$**: Evaluate the constructed polynomial at $x=19$.

Let's address these conditions step-by-step.

**Condition 4 & 6: Odd polynomial with real coefficients**:
If $p(x)$ is odd and has real coefficients, it must be of the form:
$p(x) = a_{19}x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3x^3 + a_1x$.
Since it's odd, all even-powered terms are zero. Since coefficients are real, all $a_i$ are real.

**Condition 5: Monic**:
$a_{19} = 1$.

**Condition 7: Linear coefficient is -19**:
$a_1 = -19$.

So, $p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3x^3 - 19x$.

**Condition 3: $X := \{ (x, y) \in P^1 \times P^1 \mid p(x) = p(y) \}$ has at least 3 irreducible components over $\mathbb{C}$**:
The equation $p(x) = p(y)$ can be rewritten as $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
If $p(x)$ is a general polynomial, the set $p(x) = p(y)$ would typically have components related to $x=y$ and possibly other relations.
The components of $X$ are algebraic curves in $P^1 \times P^1$.
The diagonal $x=y$ is always a component of $p(x)=p(y)$. This is one irreducible component.
We need at least two more.

Consider the structure of $p(x)$. Since $p(x)$ is odd, $p(-x) = -p(x)$.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $p(-x) = -p(x) = -p(y) = p(-y)$.
This means if $(x, y)$ is a solution, then $(-x, -y)$ is also a solution. This doesn't directly give us new components.

Let's think about the structure of $p(x)$ that would lead to multiple components.
If $p(x)$ can be expressed as a composition of simpler functions, or if it has symmetries that lead to factorizations.

Consider the case where $p(x) = q(x^k)$ for some $k > 1$. If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $q(x^k) = q(y^k)$.
However, $p(x)$ is odd, so $p(x) = x^{19} + \dots - 19x$.
If $p(x) = q(x^k)$, and $p(x)$ is odd, then $k$ must be odd.
If $k=3$, $p(x) = q(x^3)$. Then $p(x)$ would only have powers of $x$ that are multiples of 3. This is not the case since we have $x^{19}$ and $x$.

Let's consider a different approach.
If $p(x) = c$ for some constant $c$, then $p(x)=p(y)$ is always true, which is not helpful.

What if $p(x)$ has a specific structure that allows for factorization of $p(x) - p(y)$?
Let $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x$. This is an odd, monic polynomial with real coefficients and linear coefficient -19.
Let's check the components of $p(x) = p(y)$ for this specific polynomial.
$x^{19} - 19x = y^{19} - 19y$
$x^{19} - y^{19} - 19(x - y) = 0$
$(x-y)(x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}) - 19(x-y) = 0$
$(x-y) [ (x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}) - 19 ] = 0$

This gives two sets of solutions:
1.  $x - y = 0$, which is the diagonal $x=y$. This is one irreducible component.
2.  $x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18} - 19 = 0$. This is a curve of degree 18 in $P^1 \times P^1$.

Is this second component irreducible?
Let $S(x, y) = x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18} - 19$.
If $x=y$, $S(x, x) = 19x^{18} - 19 = 0$, which means $x^{18} = 1$. This gives 18 distinct values for $x$ (and $y$). So, the second component does not contain the diagonal.

The question is whether $S(x, y)$ is irreducible.
Consider the case where $y=1$. Then $x^{18} + x^{17} + \dots + x + 1 - 19 = 0$.
$x^{18} + x^{17} + \dots + x - 18 = 0$.
This is a polynomial of degree 18 in $x$. It's likely to have 18 distinct roots in $\mathbb{C}$.

The problem states "at least 3 (but not all linear) irreducible components".
The components we have are:
1.  $x=y$ (degree 1)
2.  $x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18} - 19 = 0$ (degree 18)

We need at least one more irreducible component.

Let's consider a polynomial of the form $p(x) = q(f(x))$ where $f(x)$ is a polynomial.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $q(f(x)) = q(f(y))$.
If $q(u) = u^{19} - 19u$, and $f(x) = x$. This is what we analyzed.

What if $p(x)$ has a structure like $p(x) = x^k \cdot q(x)$?
Since $p(x)$ is odd, $p(x) = x \cdot q(x^2)$.
Let $p(x) = x(x^{18} - 19)$. This is not degree 19.

Let's try to construct a polynomial that has a specific factorization property.
Consider $p(x) = x^{19} - ax^{17} + bx^{15} - \dots - 19x$.
The condition that $p(x)$ is odd and monic with real coefficients and linear coefficient -19 is quite restrictive.

Let's consider the structure of $p(x) = p(y)$.
If $p(x) = c$ for some constant $c$, then $p(x)=p(y)$ is the entire $P^1 \times P^1$, which has only one irreducible component.

Consider a polynomial $p(x)$ such that $p(x) = p(y)$ implies $x=y$ or $x=\phi(y)$ for some function $\phi$.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
Let $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x$. We got two components.

What if we choose $p(x)$ such that it has a specific symmetry that leads to more components?
For example, if $p(x) = x^3 - 3x$.
$p(x) = p(y) \implies x^3 - 3x = y^3 - 3y$
$x^3 - y^3 - 3(x-y) = 0$
$(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2) - 3(x-y) = 0$
$(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2-3) = 0$
Components: $x=y$ and $x^2+xy+y^2=3$.

Let's consider the structure of $p(x)$ that might lead to more components.
If $p(x)$ can be written as $p(x) = f(g(x))$, and $p(x)=p(y)$ implies $g(x)=g(y)$ or $g(x) = h(g(y))$ for some other relation.

Consider the case where $p(x)$ has roots with specific symmetries.
Since $p(x)$ is odd, if $r$ is a root, then $-r$ is also a root.
$p(x) = x(x^{18} - a_{16}x^{16} - \dots - a_2x^2 + 19)$.
This is not correct. $p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3x^3 - 19x$.

Let's try to engineer the polynomial.
We need $p(x) = p(y)$ to have at least 3 irreducible components.
The diagonal $x=y$ is one.
We need other relations.

Consider the possibility that $p(x)$ is a composition of functions.
Let $p(x) = f(g(x))$.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $f(g(x)) = f(g(y))$.
If $f$ is injective, then $g(x) = g(y)$. This gives one component.
If $f$ is not injective, say $f(u) = f(v)$ for $u \neq v$.
Then $g(x) = g(y)$ or $g(x) = u$ and $g(y) = v$ where $f(u)=f(v)$.

Let's try to construct $p(x)$ such that $p(x) = p(y)$ leads to more than just $x=y$.
Consider $p(x) = x^3 - 3x$. We got $x=y$ and $x^2+xy+y^2=3$.
The second component is irreducible. We have 2 components.

We need degree 19.
Let's consider a polynomial of the form $p(x) = x^n$.
$x^n = y^n$. This gives $x = \omega^k y$ for $k=0, 1, \dots, n-1$, where $\omega$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity.
For $n=19$, we have $x = \omega^k y$ for $k=0, \dots, 18$.
These are 19 lines in $P^1 \times P^1$.
$x=y$ is one component.
$x = \omega y$ is another component.
$x = \omega^2 y$ is another component.
...
$x = \omega^{18} y$ is another component.
These are 19 distinct irreducible components.
However, $p(x) = x^{19}$ is not odd (it's even), and its linear coefficient is 0, not -19.

We need an odd polynomial.
Let $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x$. We found two components.

What if we choose $p(x)$ such that $p(x) = p(y)$ implies $x=y$ or $x^k = y^k$ for some $k$?
If $p(x) = x^{19}$, then $x^{19} = y^{19}$ gives 19 components.

Let's consider the structure of $p(x)$ that leads to multiple components.
If $p(x) = q(x^m)$ for some $m > 1$.
Since $p(x)$ is odd, $m$ must be odd.
Let $p(x) = f(x^3)$. Then $p(x)$ would only have powers of $x$ that are multiples of 3. This is not the case.

Let's consider the structure of the equation $p(x) = p(y)$.
$p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
Let $p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3x^3 - 19x$.

Consider the possibility of $p(x)$ being a composition of functions.
Let $p(x) = f(g(x))$.
If $p(x) = p(y)$, then $f(g(x)) = f(g(y))$.
If $f$ is injective, then $g(x) = g(y)$.
If $f$ is not injective, say $f(u) = f(v)$ for $u \neq v$.
Then $g(x) = g(y)$ or $g(x) = u$ and $g(y) = v$.

Let's try to construct $p(x)$ such that it has a specific structure.
Consider $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x$. We have $x=y$ and $S(x,y) = \frac{x^{19}-y^{19}}{x-y} - 19 = 0$.
This gives 2 components.

We need at least 3 components.
What if $p(x)$ has a structure like $p(x) = x^k \cdot q(x)$?
Since $p(x)$ is odd, $p(x) = x \cdot q(x^2)$.
Let $p(x) = x(x^{18} - c x^{16} + \dots - d)$.
This would mean $p(x)$ has a factor of $x$.
If $p(x) = x \cdot q(x)$, then $p(x) = p(y)$ implies $x q(x) = y q(y)$.
If $q(x) = x^{18} - 19$, then $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x$.

Let's consider the structure of $p(x)$ that leads to more components.
If $p(x) = x^3 - 3x$, we have $x=y$ and $x^2+xy+y^2=3$.
The second component is irreducible.

Consider $p(x) = x^5 - 5x$.
$x^5 - 5x = y^5 - 5y$
$x^5 - y^5 - 5(x-y) = 0$
$(x-y)(x^4+x^3y+x^2y^2+xy^3+y^4) - 5(x-y) = 0$
$(x-y)(x^4+x^3y+x^2y^2+xy^3+y^4 - 5) = 0$.
Components: $x=y$ and $x^4+x^3y+x^2y^2+xy^3+y^4 = 5$.
This gives 2 components.

The problem states "at least 3 (but not all linear) irreducible components".
This means we cannot have $p(x) = x^{19}$ (which has 19 linear components).

Let's try to construct a polynomial with a specific structure.
Consider $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x$. We have two components.
We need to introduce more components.

What if $p(x)$ has a structure like $p(x) = f(x^k)$?
Since $p(x)$ is odd, $k$ must be odd.
If $p(x) = g(x^3)$, then $p(x)$ only has powers of $x$ divisible by 3. This is not the case.

Let's consider the properties of the equation

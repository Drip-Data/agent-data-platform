If the user has a specific project in mind, `search_file_content` could be used to search within project files for specific keywords related to patterns. Without a specific project, searching for general patterns might be better done with a web search tool, which is not directly available in this step. However, `search_file_content` could be used to search for files that *contain* descriptions of patterns if such files were accessible. Given the current context, it is unclear if there are project files to search. If the goal is to find general Python data analysis code patterns, a web search would be more appropriate. If the goal is to find patterns within existing code, then `search_file_content` or `list_code_definitions` would be used on those files. Since the previous web search failed, and no project files are specified, I will assume the user wants to find general patterns and will try to use `search_file_content` to look for files that might contain such information, if any are accessible. If not, I will have to state that I cannot fulfill this part of the request without more context or accessible files.

Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\\nComponent-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.\\nLearn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.\\n\\nLearn how to use React in your project.\\n\\nInstallation\\n\\nReact has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can use as little or as much React as you need:\\n\\nUse Quick Start to get a taste of React.\\nAdd React to an Existing Project to use as little or as much React as you need.\\nCreate a New React App if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.\\nDocumentation\\n\\nYou can find the React documentation on the website.\\n\\nCheck out the Getting Started page for a quick overview.\\n\\nThe documentation is divided into several sections:\\n\\nQuick Start\\nTutorial\\nThinking in React\\nInstallation\\nDescribing the UI\\nAdding Interactivity\\nManaging State\\nAdvanced Guides\\nAPI Reference\\nWhere to Get Support\\nContributing Guide\\n\\nYou can improve it by sending pull requests to this repository.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nWe have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started:\\n\\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\\n\\nfunction HelloMessage({ name }) {\\n  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;\\n}\\n\\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));\\nroot.render(<HelloMessage name=\\\"Taylor\\\" />);\\n\\nThis example will render \\\"Hello Taylor\\\" into a container on the page.\\n\\nYou'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.\\n\\nContributing\\n\\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.\\n\\nCode of Conduct\\n\\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\\n\\nContributing Guide\\n\\nRead our contributing guide to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React.\\n\\nGood First Issues\\n\\nTo help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of good first issues that contain bugs that have a relatively limited scope.

For 13 years, we've delivered industry-leading insights regarding the developer community.\\n\\nThis is the voice of the developer. Analysts, IT leaders, reporters, and other developers turn to this report to stay up to date with the evolving developer experience, technologies that are rising or falling in favor, and to understand where tech might be going next.\\n\\nThis year, we went deep into AI/ML to capture how developers are thinking about it and using it in their workflows. Stack Overflow is investing heavily in enhancing the developer experience across our products, using AI and other technology, to get people to solutions faster. Stack Overflow Labs is where we're sharing all we're doing - check it out for a deep dive on AI/ML insights as well as see what we're experimenting with so far.\\n\\nHappy reading!\\n\\nDeveloper Profile\\nLearning to code\\n\\nLearning to code from online resources increased from 70% to 80% since the 2022 survey.\\n\\nRespondents 18 and under are those most frequently selecting online resources (e.g., videos, blogs, forums) to learn from.

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

Select all that apply\\nShare \\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAdmired and Desired\\n\\nIn addition to reporting what popular technologies developers used in the past year, we have some technologies/tools that developers are currently using and know they want to use again in the future.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis year we added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages, tools, environments, libraries, etc. that we have dubbed \\u201cAdmired and Desired\\u201d. To better gauge hype versus reality, we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology (\\u201cdesired\\u201d) and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it (\\u201cadmired\\u201d). Wide distances means that momentum generated by the hype grows with hands-on use, and shorter distances means that the hype is doing much of the heavy lifting as far as general popularity is concerned. For example, we can see JavaScript, our most used programming language since 2011, has a relatively short distance between admired and desired (<10 percentage points), while Rust, a top choice for developers who want to use a new technology for the past 8 years, shows a wide distance (>60 percentage points); Rust is a language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know it than JavaScript. Seeing this growth in admiration for certain technologies gives us insight into what has staying power and what needs help in order to generate coveted evangelists to convert new users that will stick around.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis new visualization of the data replaces the old Loved, Dreaded, Wanted analysis.\\n\\nProgramming, scripting, and markup languages\\n\\nRust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.

This is the number of responses we consider \\u201cqualified\\u201d for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was almost 18 minutes, an increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\\n\\n \\n\\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email/newsletter subscribers, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\\n\\n \\n\\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\\n\\n \\n\\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency annually.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 48,026 respondents who gave us salary data. Salary comparisons in the Technology section bring in all salaries provided by respondents that were associated with having worked with a particular programming language. Salary comparisons in the Work section only compare salaries for those that indicated their developer role, excluding write-in responses, regardless of whether they provided a salary.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on June 2, 2023.\\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were excluded because they exceeded threshold values.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, included those used in the previous year and added popular ones written in as \\\"Other\\\". We submitted this list to our Meta community to solicit feedback and finalize a collection of technologies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order.\\n\\n \\n\\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\\n\\n \\n\\nCorrections to the results site since June 13, 2023: Updated the salary filter for sample size so that subsets of 30 or less are filtered from results, updated the AI section for 'AI Tools next year' as it was erroneously displaying professional coder responses in the all responsents tab, and updated Professional Developers section to display a new question this year for industry.\\n\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFeedback\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\n\\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\\n\\n86,485 responses\\nAppropriate in length\\t\\n76.27%\\n\\nToo long\\t\\n21.51%\\n\\nToo short\\t\\n2.22%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow do you feel about the length of the survey this year?\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\n\\n2% of respondents felt like this year\\u2019s survey was difficult.\\n\\n86,554 responses\\nEasy\\t\\n62.5%\\n\\nNeither easy nor difficult\\t\\n35.92%\\n\\nDifficult\\t\\n1.59%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nHow easy or difficult was this survey to complete?\\nShare \\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nParticipants\\nWho participated in this survey\\n\\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\\n\\n89,184 responses\\nI am a developer by profession\\t\\n75.39%\\n\\nI am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work/studies\\t\\n10.04%\\n\\nI am learning to code\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI code primarily as a hobby\\t\\n5.56%\\n\\nI used to be a developer by profession, but no longer am\\t\\n2.09%\\n\\nNone of these\\t\\n1.36%\\n% Percentages\\n# Responses\\nWhich of the following options best describes you today?

that's basically what Bitcoin's blockchain is.\\n\\nWhen you send Bitcoin to someone, that transaction gets broadcast to a network of computers around the world.\\n\\nThese computers, called miners, work together to verify transactions and group them into 'blocks' - kind of like pages in that giant ledger.\\n\\nTo make sure everyone agrees on which transactions happened when, Bitcoin uses something called 'proof-of-work'.\\n\\nThink of it like a really hard math puzzle that computers have to solve.\\n\\nThe first computer to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block of transactions to the chain and receives some new Bitcoin as a reward.\\n\\nThis system makes it extremely difficult for anyone to cheat or change past transactions because they'd have to redo all those puzzles and convince everyone to accept their version of events.\\n\\nThe beauty of Bitcoin's design is that it doesn't require trust in any single person or organization.\\n\\nInstead, it relies on mathematics, cryptography, and the fact that it's more profitable for participants to play by the rules than to try to cheat the system.\\n\\nTokenomics\\n\\nBitcoin's economic system is designed to work like digital gold.\\n\\nJust like there's a limited amount of gold in the world, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin.\\n\\nNew Bitcoin are created through mining - when computers solve those complex puzzles to verify transactions, they're rewarded with newly created Bitcoin.\\n\\nThis reward started at 50 Bitcoin per block and gets cut in half about every four years in what's called the 'halving'.\\n\\nCurrently, miners receive 3.125 Bitcoin for each block they add to the chain, with the next halving expected in 2028, which will reduce the reward to 1.5625 Bitcoin.\\n\\nThis decreasing supply schedule makes Bitcoin naturally resistant to inflation, unlike traditional money that can be printed by governments at will.\\n\\nWhen people make Bitcoin transactions, they can also include small fees that go to the miners.\\n\\nThese fees help incentivize miners to keep processing transactions even as the block rewards get smaller over time.\\n\\nAs of early 2025, almost 20 million Bitcoin have already been mined, with the final Bitcoin expected to be mined around the year 2140.\\n\\nRoadmap\\n\\nBitcoin's development follows a careful, conservative approach focused on maintaining security and stability.\\n\\nUnlike many other crypto projects, Bitcoin doesn't have a formal roadmap or a single team controlling its development.\\n\\nInstead, improvements are proposed, discussed, and implemented through a community-driven process.\\n\\nMajor updates require broad consensus among users, miners, and developers to be adopted.\\n\\nCurrent development efforts focus on improving Bitcoin's scalability through solutions like the Lightning Network, which allows for faster and cheaper transactions, and enhancing privacy and security features.\\n\\nRecent developments include Taproot, a major upgrade implemented in 2021 that improves privacy and smart contract functionality.\\n\\nThe community is also working on various Layer 2 solutions and sidechains to enhance Bitcoin's utility while maintaining its core principles of security and decentralization.\\n\\nTeam\\n\\nBitcoin was created by someone using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 and launched the network in 2009.\\n\\nSatoshi's true identity remains unknown, and they stepped away from the project in 2010.\\n\\nToday, Bitcoin is maintained by a global community of developers who contribute to its open-source code.\\n\\nNo single person or organization controls Bitcoin - its development and operation are truly decentralized, which is a key feature that makes it resistant to control or manipulation by any single entity.\\n\\nThe development community has grown significantly since Bitcoin's inception, with numerous contributors working on various aspects of the protocol, from core development to Layer 2 solutions.\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nSimilar Coins to Bitcoin\\nSources\\n\\nOur website uses cookies to enhance user experience, analyse traffic, for security and assist in our marketing campaigns.

I've already navigated to Yahoo Finance pages for both companies' financial statements.  The next step is to extract the relevant financial data (e.g., revenue, net income, etc.) for a period of time (e.g., the last 5 years) for both companies.  This data will then be used in a Python script to create visualizations.  Since the Yahoo Finance page structure is not guaranteed to be consistent, I will need to carefully inspect the page source to find appropriate CSS selectors for extracting the data.  I will focus on extracting data from the \"Financials\" tab.  After data extraction, I will use Python's `pandas` and `matplotlib` or `seaborn` libraries to create visualizations like line charts comparing revenue and net income over time.  Finally, I will analyze the charts to draw conclusions about the companies' performance.",

I will then need to devise a strategy for extracting license information from the pages.  A simple approach would be to search for the license file name (e.g., LICENSE, LICENSE.txt) within the repository's files.  However, this might not be completely reliable as some projects might use different naming conventions.  A more robust approach would involve parsing the repository's metadata, which might require more complex web scraping techniques.

The browser has already navigated to GitHub search pages for each license type. However, the current browser state shows that the search for `license:apache` returned 0 repositories.  This suggests that simply extracting the number of repositories from the search result page might not be reliable.  A more robust approach would be to extract the number of results from each search page's metadata (likely hidden in the page source, not directly visible).  Alternatively, we could try to navigate to the next page of results if there are more than one page.  However, given the current 0 results, this is unlikely to be necessary for Apache.  We need to collect data for MIT and GPL licenses as well.  Therefore, the next step is to extract the number of repositories found for each license type from the previously visited pages.  We'll use `browser_get_text` with appropriate selectors to extract this information, and then use `python_execute` to process and analyze the data.",

The next step is to extract the relevant comparison information from the Wikipedia page and then generate a Python report.  Since the Wikipedia page is already loaded, I will extract the text content using `browser_get_text` and then use `python_execute` to process the text, creating a comparison report.  I will use simple text processing to extract key differences; a more sophisticated approach might involve NLP techniques, but that's beyond the scope of this simple test.",

The first step is to navigate to a financial website that provides this information, such as Yahoo Finance or Google Finance.

The browser is currently on the Yahoo Finance page for AAPL.  We need to extract the relevant data for AAPL, then navigate to TSLA's page and extract its data as well.  Finally, we'll use Python to process this data, create a chart, and perform a basic comparative analysis.  Since no previous steps are provided, we'll start by extracting the price and market cap for AAPL.  Then we'll repeat the process for TSLA.  The analysis will be rudimentary, focusing on a simple price comparison and market cap difference.  More sophisticated analysis would require more data and a more complex model.",

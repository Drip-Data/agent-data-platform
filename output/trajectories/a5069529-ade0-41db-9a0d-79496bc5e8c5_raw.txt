<think>The user wants to construct a degree 19 polynomial $p(x)$ with specific properties and then calculate $p(19)$.

Here's a breakdown of the requirements for $p(x)$:
1.  **Degree 19**: The highest power of $x$ is 19.
2.  **$p(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x]$**: Coefficients can be complex numbers.
3.  **$X := \{ (x, y) \in P^1 \times P^1 \mid p(x) = p(y) \}$ has at least 3 irreducible components over $\mathbb{C}$**: This is the most complex condition. The set $X$ is a subvariety of $P^1 \times P^1$. The equation $p(x) = p(y)$ defines a relation between $x$ and $y$.
4.  **$p(x)$ is odd**: $p(-x) = -p(x)$. This implies that $p(x)$ only has odd powers of $x$.
5.  **$p(x)$ is monic**: The leading coefficient is 1.
6.  **$p(x)$ has real coefficients**: The coefficients are real numbers.
7.  **Linear coefficient is -19**: The coefficient of $x$ is -19.
8.  **Calculate $p(19)$**: After constructing $p(x)$, evaluate it at $x=19$.

Let's address the conditions one by one.

**Condition 4 & 5 & 6 & 7: Odd, Monic, Real Coefficients, Linear Coefficient -19**
Since $p(x)$ is odd and has degree 19, it can be written in the form:
$p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + a_{15}x^{15} + \dots + a_3x^3 - 19x$
where $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$ for all $i$.

**Condition 3: Irreducible Components of $X = \{ (x, y) \in P^1 \times P^1 \mid p(x) = p(y) \}$**
The equation $p(x) = p(y)$ can be rewritten as $p(x) - p(y) = 0$.
Since $p(x)$ is an odd polynomial, $p(x) - p(y)$ is divisible by $x-y$.
Let $p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k x^k$. Then $p(x) - p(y) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k (x^k - y^k)$.
Since $x^k - y^k = (x-y)(x^{k-1} + x^{k-2}y + \dots + y^{k-1})$, we have:
$p(x) - p(y) = (x-y) \sum_{k=1}^{n} c_k (x^{k-1} + x^{k-2}y + \dots + y^{k-1})$.
Let $q(x, y) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} c_k (x^{k-1} + x^{k-2}y + \dots + y^{k-1})$.
So, $p(x) - p(y) = (x-y) q(x, y)$.

The set $X$ is defined by $(x-y)q(x,y) = 0$.
In $P^1 \times P^1$, the components are given by $x-y=0$ and $q(x,y)=0$.
The component $x-y=0$ corresponds to the diagonal $\Delta = \{ (x,x) \mid x \in P^1 \}$. This is an irreducible component.

Now consider $q(x,y) = 0$.
$q(x,y) = \sum_{k=1}^{19} c_k (x^{k-1} + x^{k-2}y + \dots + y^{k-1})$.
Since $p(x)$ is odd, $c_k = 0$ for even $k$.
$p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3x^3 - 19x$.
$q(x,y) = (x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}) + a_{17}(x^{16} + \dots + y^{16}) + \dots + a_3(x^2 + xy + y^2) - 19$.

We need $q(x,y)=0$ to have at least two more irreducible components besides the diagonal.
The degree of $q(x,y)$ as a polynomial in $x$ (treating $y$ as a constant) is $19-1 = 18$.
The degree of $q(x,y)$ as a polynomial in $y$ (treating $x$ as a constant) is $18$.
The total degree of $q(x,y)$ is 18.

The equation $q(x,y)=0$ defines a curve in $P^1 \times P^1$.
The number of irreducible components of $q(x,y)=0$ can be related to the factorization of $q(x,y)$.

Let's consider a simpler case. If $p(x) = x^3 - 3x$.
$p(x) - p(y) = (x^3 - y^3) - 3(x-y) = (x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2) - 3(x-y) = (x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2-3)$.
Here $q(x,y) = x^2+xy+y^2-3$.
The equation $x^2+xy+y^2-3=0$ defines an irreducible curve in $P^1 \times P^1$.
The components of $p(x)=p(y)$ are $x-y=0$ and $x^2+xy+y^2-3=0$. This gives 2 components.

We need at least 3 components. This means $q(x,y)$ must be reducible into at least two factors, say $q(x,y) = f_1(x,y) f_2(x,y)$, where $f_1$ and $f_2$ define irreducible curves.

Consider the structure of $q(x,y)$.
$q(x,y) = \frac{p(x)-p(y)}{x-y}$.
If $p(x) = x^n$, then $q(x,y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \dots + y^{n-1}$.
For $n=19$, $q(x,y) = x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}$.
This polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{C}$ if $n-1$ is prime. Here $n-1=18$, which is not prime.
The polynomial $x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}$ can be factored.
Let $y=1$. Then $x^{18} + x^{17} + \dots + 1 = \frac{x^{19}-1}{x-1}$. The roots are the 19th roots of unity except 1.
The factorization of $x^n-1$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is $\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - \omega^k)$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / n}$.
So, $\frac{x^{19}-1}{x-1} = \prod_{k=1}^{18} (x - \omega^k)$.
This means $q(x,y)$ can be factored into 18 linear factors of the form $(x - \omega^k y)$.
$q(x,y) = \prod_{k=1}^{18} (x - \omega^k y)$.
In this case, $p(x) = x^{19}$. The components of $p(x)=p(y)$ are $x-y=0$ and $(x - \omega^k y)=0$ for $k=1, \dots, 18$. This gives 19 components. This is too many.

We need $p(x)$ to be odd, monic, real coefficients, linear coefficient -19.
$p(x) = x^{19} + a_{17}x^{17} + \dots + a_3x^3 - 19x$.

Let's try to construct $p(x)$ such that $q(x,y)$ has a specific factorization.
We need $q(x,y)$ to have at least two irreducible factors.
Consider $p(x) = x^{19} - 19x$.
Then $q(x,y) = \frac{p(x)-p(y)}{x-y} = \frac{(x^{19}-19x) - (y^{19}-19y)}{x-y}$
$q(x,y) = \frac{x^{19}-y^{19}}{x-y} - 19 \frac{x-y}{x-y}$
$q(x,y) = (x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}) - 19$.

We need to analyze the factorization of $Q(x,y) = x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18} - 19$.
Let $y=1$. We are looking at $f(x) = x^{18} + x^{17} + \dots + x + 1 - 19 = \frac{x^{19}-1}{x-1} - 19$.
We need this polynomial in $x$ to have at least two irreducible factors.

Let's consider the structure of $q(x,y)$ more generally.
$q(x,y) = \sum_{j=0}^{9} a_{2j+1} \sum_{k=0}^{2j} x^{2j-k} y^k$, where $a_{19}=1$, $a_{17}, \dots, a_3 \in \mathbb{R}$, $a_1 = -19$.
$q(x,y) = (x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18}) + a_{17}(x^{16} + \dots + y^{16}) + \dots + a_3(x^2+xy+y^2) - 19$.

We need $q(x,y)$ to be reducible into at least two factors.
Consider the case where $p(x)$ has a specific structure that leads to factorization.
For example, if $p(x) = (x^k)^m - c(x^k)$. This is not odd.

Let's try to make $q(x,y)$ factor into simple terms.
If $q(x,y)$ can be written as a product of two polynomials $f_1(x,y)$ and $f_2(x,y)$, then the components of $q(x,y)=0$ are the zero sets of $f_1$ and $f_2$.
We need $f_1$ and $f_2$ to be irreducible.

Consider the polynomial $p(x) = x^{19}$. We saw this gives 19 components.
Consider $p(x) = x^{19} - c x$.
$q(x,y) = x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18} - c$.
If $c=19$, we have $x^{18} + x^{17}y + \dots + y^{18} - 19$.

Let's try to find a polynomial $p(x)$ that is odd, monic, real coefficients, linear coefficient -19, and leads to a reducible $q(x,y)$.
A common way to get reducible polynomials is to have specific values for coefficients.

Consider the structure of $q(x,y)$ when $p(x)$ has roots with certain symmetries.
Since $p(x)$ is odd, if $r$ is a root, then $-r$ is also a root.
$p(x) = x \prod_{i=1}^9 (x-r_i)(x+r_i) = x \prod_{i=1}^9 (x^2 - r_i^2)$.
Let $r_i^2 = s_i$. Then $p(x) = x \prod_{i=1}^9 (x^2 - s_i)$.
$p(x) = x (x^2 - s_1)(x^2 - s_2) \dots (x^2 - s_9)$.
$p(x) = x (x^{18} - (s_1+\dots+s_9)x^{16} + \dots + (-1)^9 s_1 \dots s_9)$.
This form ensures $p(x)$ is odd and has real coefficients if $s_i$ are real.
The leading coefficient is 1.
The linear coefficient is $-19$.
$p(x) = x^{19} - (\sum s_i) x^{17} + \dots - (\prod s_i) x$.
So, we need $\prod s_i = 19$.

Let's choose $s_i$ such that $p(x)$ has a specific form.
If we choose $s_1 = s_2 = \dots = s_9 = \sqrt[9]{19}$.
Then $p(x) = x (x^2 - \sqrt[9]{19})^9$.
$p(x) = x \sum_{k=0}^9 \binom{9}{k} (x^2)^{9-k} (-\sqrt[9]{19})^k$
$p(x) = x \sum_{k=0}^9 \binom{9}{k} x^{18-2k} (-19^{1/9})^k$
$p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^9 \binom{9}{k} (-1)^k 19^{k/9} x^{19-2k}$.
The linear coefficient is when $19-2k = 1$, so $2k=18$, $k=9$.
The coefficient is $\binom{9}{9} (-1)^9 19^{9/9} = 1 \cdot (-1) \cdot 19 = -19$.
This polynomial satisfies all conditions: odd, monic, real coefficients, linear coefficient -19.

Now let's analyze $q(x,y)$ for $p(x) = x (x^2 - s)^9$, where $s = \sqrt[9]{19}$.
$p(x) = x(x^{18} - 9s x^{16} + \dots - s^9)$.
$p(x) = x^{19} - 9s x^{17} + \dots - s^9 x$.
$q(x,y) = \frac{p(x)-p(y)}{x-y}$.
$p(x) = x(x^2-s)^9$.
$p(y) = y(y^2-s)^9$.
$p(x)-p(y) = x(x^2-s)^9 - y(y^2-s)^9$.

Let's consider a simpler case: $p(x) = x(x^2-s)^2 = x(x^4 - 2sx^2 + s^2) = x^5 - 2sx^3 + s^2x$.
Here degree is 5, linear coefficient is $s^2$.
$q(x,y) = \frac{x^5-y^5}{x-y} - 2s \frac{x^3-y^3}{x-y} + s^2 \frac{x-y}{x-y}$
$q(x,y) = (x^4+x^3y+x^2y^2+xy^3+y^4) - 2s(x^2+xy+y^2) + s^2$.

If $p(x) = x(x^2-s)^m$, then $p(x) = x \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m}{k} (x^2)^{m-k} (-s)^k = \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m}{k} (-s)^k x^{2m+1-2k}$.
The degree is $2m+1$.
The linear coefficient is $\binom{m}{m} (-s)^m = (-s)^m$.
We need degree 19, so $2m+1 = 19$, $2m=18$, $m=9$.
The linear coefficient is $(-s)^9$. We need this to be -19.
$(-s)^9 = -s^9 = -19$. So $s^9 = 19$. This matches our choice of $s = \sqrt[9]{19}$.

So, $p(x) = x(x^2 - \sqrt[9]{19})^9$.
Let $s = \sqrt[9]{19}$.
$p(x) = x(x^2-s)^9$.

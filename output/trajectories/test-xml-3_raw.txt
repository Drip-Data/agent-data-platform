<think>The user wants to create a calculator class in Python that supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and then test each of these functionalities. I will first define the calculator class with methods for each operation. Then, I will write test cases to verify that each method works correctly, including edge cases like division by zero. I will use the `microsandbox` tool to execute the Python code.</think>
<microsandbox>
```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b

    def divide(self, a, b):
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return a / b

# Test cases
calculator = Calculator()

# Test addition
assert calculator.add(5, 3) == 8
assert calculator.add(-5, 3) == -2
assert calculator.add(0, 0) == 0
print("Addition tests passed.")

# Test subtraction
assert calculator.subtract(5, 3) == 2
assert calculator.subtract(3, 5) == -2
assert calculator.subtract(0, 0) == 0
print("Subtraction tests passed.")

# Test multiplication
assert calculator.multiply(5, 3) == 15
assert calculator.multiply(-5, 3) == -15
assert calculator.multiply(5, 0) == 0
print("Multiplication tests passed.")

# Test division
assert calculator.divide(6, 3) == 2.0
assert calculator.divide(5, 2) == 2.5
assert calculator.divide(-6, 3) == -2.0
try:
    calculator.divide(5, 0)
    assert False, "Division by zero did not raise an error"
except ValueError as e:
    assert str(e) == "Cannot divide by zero"
    print("Division by zero test passed.")
print("Division tests passed.")

print("\nAll calculator functionalities tested successfully!")
```
</microsandbox>
<result>
Addition tests passed.
Subtraction tests passed.
Multiplication tests passed.
Division by zero test passed.
Division tests passed.

All calculator functionalities tested successfully!
</result>
<think>The code executed successfully and all the tests passed, indicating that the Calculator class is implemented correctly and supports the basic arithmetic operations as required. The tests cover positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, and the edge case of division by zero.</answer>
All calculator functionalities have been implemented and tested successfully. The `Calculator` class includes methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each method has been tested with various inputs, including positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, and the specific case of division by zero, which correctly raises a `ValueError`. The output confirms that all tests passed.
